<!-- ASSIGNMENT & NOTES:

  Prof: you can get away with 3 images (for each orientation), so 6 images total = landsacpe 3 image, square 3 images (apperently)
  but the fullproof way is yoou still need to generate 21 images

  reference from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images
  section: "Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutions"

  code to ref:
  <picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" />
  <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
  </picture>

  Note: watch the video from IMDAC -> https://imdac.github.io/modules/html/responsive-images/

  So the Img tag version is adding two more "srcset" and "sizes"
  but the <picture> way is easier to keep track of but it does have more code.

    empty:
    <picture>
        <source srcset="" media="" />
        <source srcset="" media="" />
        <source srcset="" media="" />
        <source srcset="" media="" />
        <img src="" alt="" />
    </picture>

    so the "order that matters" is the order of images in cascading order, not the actual attribute tags within the <>s of the tag.

    Filled:
        <picture>
          <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg" />
          <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" />
          <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
        </picture>

        you would need CSS to make this work.

        But if you do it the img tag way, than seems like you won't need CSS becasue the media query is inheriently inside the html code.
  
The following requirements must be met in order to complete the assignment successfully:
Using the image tables below, determine which image sizes will be necessary. There will be two image ratios: landscape and square.

Add the appropriate HTML / CSS, so that if the viewport is smaller than 960px, the image will be displayed in landscape and at an adequate resolution.
Add the appropriate HTML / CSS, so that if the viewport is 960px or larger, the image displayed is square and at an adequate resolution.
